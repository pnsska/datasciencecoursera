This is my first Coursera class

I'm still trying to figure out how this whole program works.  If I have one comment it's that there are many different items (Coursera, GitHub, R, Rstudio) that seem to be scattered around (go here, go there) it's hard to follow.  I assume that the scatter will become obvious in the near future.

I've completed the first project.  I'm understanding the repository and version control concepts.  However, the procedures are not obvious.  Pushing, pulling, committing.  What is going up to GitHub, what comes down?  Is everything done on my local computer and pushed up?  I created a HelloWorld.md in GitHub and on my local computer.  What happens now.
