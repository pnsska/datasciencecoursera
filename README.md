# datasciencecoursera
This is my first Coursera class
It is Sunday, 1/18/2015, just before the start of week 3.  I'm still trying to figure out how this whole program works.  If I have one initial comment it's that there are many different items (Coursera, GitHub, R, Rstudio) that seem to be scattered around (go here, go there) it's hard to follow.  I assume that the apparent scatter will become normal in the near future.
